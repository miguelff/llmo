            <p><a class="link link-primary" href="http://archive.today/zbDbo">Google is rapidly losing market share to ChatGPT</a>. This shift highlights how users prefer AI’s ability to provide direct responses, making information retrieval more efficient and user-friendly.</p>
            
            <h3>🧙‍♂️ But AI-based search is not magical, yet.</h3>
            
            <p>LLMs (Large Language Models) are trained on vast amounts of data, but this data is not always up-to-date. To provide the most current and accurate answers, these models need to perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) under the hood.</p>
            
            <p>RAG is a technique where the AI performs searches to gather relevant information from various sources and then generates comprehensive responses based on that data. This ensures that the answers you receive are up-to-date.</p>            

            <h3>🤔 What the hell does this mean for me?</h3>
            
            <p>To understand who you are and your qualities, <strong class="font-bold">LLMs need to see you</strong>, meaning you need to be on the first page of results for the search engines they use for RAG.</p>

            <p>And <strong class="font-bold">they also need to take you seriously</strong>. This means that, in addition to being on the first page of results, you need to be trustworthy, relevant and authoritative.</p>
