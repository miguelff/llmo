        for the brands or products, narrowing the focus to a specific subset or characteristic.
        Below are examples of how this context shifts the overarching term:\n\t1.\tBrands-Based
        Example\n\t•\tInput Brands: Nike, Adidas, Puma, Reebok, Under Armour\n\t•\tDefault
        Term: “sportswear brands”\n\t•\tUser Query: “Which brands make the best running

        SUVs?”\n\t•\tResulting Term: “luxury electric SUVs”\n\nInstructions\n\n\t•\tStep
        1: Identify the initial overarching term based on the input brands or products.\n\t•\tStep
        2: Analyze the user query to determine its focus, specificity, or intent.\n\t•\tStep
        3: Refine the overarching term to align with the query’s context.\n\t•\tStep
        4: Provide the final term with clarity and relevance to the user’s request.
        \n    •\tStep 5: Term should be 1 - 3 words, not longer, if it is, summarize
        it or abstract it.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"* products: Volkswagen VW
