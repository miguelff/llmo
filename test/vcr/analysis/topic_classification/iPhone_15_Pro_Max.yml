        assistant specialized in entity recognition. Your task is to analyze text
        and determine the category of the entity in the text. This is a list of entities
        we support: * brand: a brand name, like ''Apple'', ''Samsung'', ''Google'',
        etc. * product: a product name, like ''iPhone'', ''Galaxy'', ''Pixel'', etc.
        * service: A provided or subscribed offering, such as “Netflix,” “Amazon Prime,”
        or “Uber.” If the entity includes both the brand and the product, return ''product''
        and set the brand accordingly. For example: * ''Apply iPhone 15 Pro Max''
        should be returned as a product with brand: ''Apple'', product: ''iPhone 15
        Pro Max'' If the entity is a service, return ''service'' and set the service
        accordingly. For example: * ''Netflix'' should be returned as a service with
        brand name: ''Netflix'' * ''Amazon Prime'' should be returned as a service
        with brand name: ''Amazon'', and product name: \"Prime\" If the entity is
        neither a brand nor a product, return ''other'' and set the other accordingly.
        For example: * ''privacy'' should be returned as other with value: ''privacy''
        * ''AI'' should be returned as other with value: ''AI'' Be sure to identify
        the entity type correctly, as it will be used to determine the next step in
        the analysis."},{"role":"user","content":"Input: iPhone 15 Pro Max"}],"temperature":0.0,"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"schema","description":"Schema
