        The official name of the brand, company, or service that the website belongs
        to.\n- Category: The product or service category the brand offers (e.g., fashion,
        software, food \u0026 beverages, etc.).\n- Description: A short summary of
        what the brand does and its key focus areas. If the website details do not
        include information about a region where the brand operates most specifically,
        omit it.\n- Region: The geographical region where the brand operates primarily
        or where its main competitors are located.\n- Keywords: A list of SEO keywords,
        to reach the website. Low volume and high difficulty keywords are preferred.

        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould

        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted

        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed

        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"name\":\"schema\",\"description\":\"Schema
        for the structured response\",\"schema\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"competitors\":{\"type\":\"array\",\"items\":{\"$ref\":\"#/$defs/competitor\"},\"description\":\"A
        list of competitors\"}},\"required\":[\"competitors\"],\"additionalProperties\":false,\"strict\":true,\"$defs\":{\"competitor\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"name\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        name of the competitor\"},\"url\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The
        URL of the competitor''s website\"}},\"required\":[\"name\",\"url\"],\"additionalProperties\":false,\"strict\":true}}}}\n```\n\nWhat
        are the main competitors of the brand Reveni?\nThe brand belongs to the following
        product or service category: eCommerce Solutions.\nThe brand''s website appears
        when using the following search queries in Bing:\n* {\"value\"=\u003e\"eCommerce
        returns optimization\"}\n* {\"value\"=\u003e\"instant refunds solutions\"}\n*

        loyalty enhancement\"}\n* {\"value\"=\u003e\"eCommerce exchange solutions\"}\nAnd
        maybe competitors are found when using similar search queries.\nBe mindful
        to not hallucinate competitors.\nFor each competitor, provide the name of
        the competitor and the URL of a its website, only official websites are accepted.
        Comparators, blogs, news sites, that mention the brand are not accepted\nBe
        sure to not include the own brand being analyzed in the list of competitors\nUse
