        format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given \"JSON Schema\"
        instance.\n\n\"JSON Schema\" is a declarative language that allows you to
        annotate and validate JSON documents.\n\nFor example, the example \"JSON Schema\"
        instance {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"description\": \"a list of test words\",
        \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}}\nwould
        match an object with one required property, \"foo\". The \"type\" property
        specifies \"foo\" must be an \"array\", and the \"description\" property semantically
        describes it as \"a list of test words\". The items within \"foo\" must be
        strings.\nThus, the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted
        instance of this example \"JSON Schema\". The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\":
        [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}}} is not well-formatted.\n\nYour output will be parsed
        and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all
        fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!\n\nHere
        is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing
        markdown codeblock:\n```json\n{\"name\":\"schema\",\"description\":\"Schema
        for the structured response\",\"schema\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"competitors\":{\"type\":\"array\",\"items\":{\"$ref\":\"#/$defs/competitor\"},\"description\":\"A

        maybe competitors are found when using similar search queries.\nBe mindful
        to not hallucinate competitors.\nFor each competitor, provide the name of
        the competitor and the URL of a its website, only official websites are accepted.
