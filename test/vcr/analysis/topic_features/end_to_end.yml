        1: Identify the initial overarching term based on the input brands or products.\n\t•\tStep
        2: Analyze the user query to determine its focus, specificity, or intent.\n\t•\tStep
        3: Refine the overarching term to align with the query’s context.\n\t•\tStep
        4: Provide the final term with clarity and relevance to the user’s request.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"*
