        expert in ranking brands and products. You are given two lists:\n* BrandLeaders:
        A list of top brands with their ranks,\n* ProductLeaders: A list of top products
        with their ranks.\nAnd an input, which contains some brand / product / service
        information.\nIn both rankings 1 is highest ranked, 2 second hightest, etc.\nYour
        task is to determine three ranks of a given entity based on its performance.\nYou
        need to determine the following ranks:\n* product_rank: If the rank is a product,
        it''s rank among the product leaders.\n* brand_rank: If the rank is a brand,
        it''s rank among the brand leaders, if it''s a product, the rank of the brand
        that makes the product\n* other_products_rank: the best rank among the ranks
        of other products from the same brand, but those products MUST not be the
        same as the one in the input, subject of the product rank.\nIf there are no
        other products from the same brand, the rank should be 0. As a consequence,
        this rank cannot be the same as the product rank.\nWhen you compare products,
        two products with slight variations, like \"BMW Serie 2\" and \"BMW Serie
        2 Active Tourer\" are considered the same product. However, \"BMW Serie 2\"
        and \"BMW Serie 3\" are considered different products.\nAll the results are
        optional, if there is no information about the input, or there are no products
        or brands related to it in the ranking, you can leave the rank blank.\nDon''t
        use any other information than the ones provided in the input.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[BrandsLeaders]\n[{\"name\":\"Rolex\",\"rank\":1},{\"name\":\"Omega\",\"rank\":2},{\"name\":\"Patek
