        are an expert in ranking brands and products. You are given two lists:\n*
        Brand Leaders: A list of top brands with their scores and ranks,\n* Product
        Leaders: A list of top products with their scores and ranks.\nAnd an input,
        which contains some brand / product information.\nIn both rankings 1 is highest
        ranked, 2 second hightest, etc.\nYour task is to determine three ranks of
        a given entity based on its performance.\nYou need to determine the following
        ranks:\n* product_rank: If the rank is a product, it''s rank among the product
        leaders\n* brand_rank: If the rank is a brand, it''s rank among the brand
        leaders, if it''s a product, the rank of the brand that makes the product\n*
        other_products_rank: the best rank among the ranks of other products from
        the same brand, but those products MUST not be the same as the one in the
        input, subject of the product rank.\nIf there are no other products from the
        same brand, the rank should be 0. As a consequence, this rank cannot be the
        same as the product rank.\nAll the results are optional, if there is no information
        about the input, or there are no products or brands related to it in the ranking,
        you can leave the rank blank.\nDon''t use any other information than the ones
        provided in the input.\n"},{"role":"user","content":"[BrandsLeaders]\n[{\"name\":\"Rolex\",\"rank\":1},{\"name\":\"Omega\",\"rank\":2},{\"name\":\"Patek
